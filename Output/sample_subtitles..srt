1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,939
I'm going to ask you to participate in an experiment, which is that when you leave this

2
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:17,539
room, when you go out into the world today, tomorrow, whenever you feel like it, I'd like

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:23,000
you to ask and answer one question of someone who's a stranger.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,539
You might meet them on the bus, you might meet them walking down the street, and I'm going

5
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,539
to show you the question that I'm going to ask you to ask and answer.

6
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,539
The question is, when was the last time you cried in front of someone?

7
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:40,379
Now just out of curiosity, how many of you are really excited about this experiment?

8
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,140
Not no hands went up whatsoever.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,299
And that makes sense, right?

10
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:49,219
Because there can be nothing that seems more intimidating or less fun than finding

11
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,539
a stranger asking them when they've cried in front of someone else and then telling

12
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:55,259
them about the time you cried in front of someone else.

13
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,659
But I'm going to try and convince you over the next few minutes that this experiment is

14
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:05,619
not only worth doing, it's worth doing whenever you can, because it will make your life better.

15
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:06,619
And explain how I got to this.

16
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:09,379
I have to tell you a little bit of a story about me and my wife.

17
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:12,019
A few years ago, we got into this bad pattern.

18
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,699
We've been married for 20 years, but I would come home from a long day at the office.

19
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:19,420
It was a reporter at the New York Times at that point, and I would start complaining about

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,900
my day, about how I'm not appreciated enough.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,859
And my wife very reasonably would offer me some great advice.

22
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,060
She would say something like, why don't you take your boss out to lunch?

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,500
And you guys can get to know each other a little bit better.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,740
And instead of being able to hear her, I would get even more upset.

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,659
And I would say things like, where are you supporting me?

26
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,820
You should be outraged on my behalf.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,900
And she would get upset because I was attacking her for giving me good advice.

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,219
This was not, anyone never had an experience like this?

29
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,579
It was not in a good situation.

30
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,980
And so I went and I started talking to researchers who were setting communication.

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,260
I asked them, why am I getting into this pattern?

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,579
And they said, well, you're making a mistake.

33
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,620
We're living through this golden age of understanding communication, really for the first time, because

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,859
of advances in neural imaging and data collection.

35
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,819
And they said, one of the big things that we've learned is that we tend to think of a discussion

36
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,219
as being just one conversation.

37
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,219
Right?

38
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:13,300
We're talking about one thing, my day, or the kids' grades, what to have for dinner.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,099
But what they said is that actually each discussion contains many different conversations.

40
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,780
And in general, these conversations tend to fall into one of three buckets.

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,939
There's these practical conversations.

42
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,060
We were talking about what's this at all about?

43
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,900
What are we really discussing?

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,580
But then there's emotional conversations.

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,539
We were talking about how do we feel?

46
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,819
And Michael is to share with you my feelings and I don't want you to solve them.

47
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,939
I want you to empathize.

48
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,460
And then there's conversations that are social conversations about who we are, the social

49
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,060
identities that are important to us, how we relate to each other and how we relate to society.

50
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,099
And what the researchers said is what we've learned is that if people having different

51
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,379
conversations at the same moment, they can't really hear each other.

52
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,539
They can't really connect.

53
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,340
And in fact, this is exactly what was happening with me and my wife, right?

54
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,780
I was coming home and having an emotional conversation.

55
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,299
My wife was responding with a practical conversation.

56
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,299
They are both legitimate conversations.

57
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:14,099
But because we weren't having the same conversation at the same moment, we weren't really communicating

58
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,900
with each other.

59
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,299
And within neurology and psychology, this insight has become so important that it's become

60
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,379
known as the matching principle.

61
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,740
Which says that successful communication requires recognizing what kind of conversation is

62
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,259
occurring and then matching each other.

63
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,979
But how do we do that?

64
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:33,579
Well, in schools, they've actually taught teachers to do this.

65
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,539
If you are a school teacher and you'll probably learn at some point that if a student comes

66
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,060
up to you with a problem or they want something they want to talk about, you should ask them,

67
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,139
do you want to be helped, which is a practical conversation?

68
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:48,099
Do you want to be hugged, which is an emotional conversation, or do you want to be heard, which

69
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,219
is a social conversation?

70
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:51,219
And it seems to work.

71
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,180
It seems like if you ask students what they need, they'll tell you.

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,780
But of course, that is hard to do in real life, right?

73
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,060
If you go up and you ask someone at work, if they want to hug, the HR might get involved.

74
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,419
So you might not want to do that.

75
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:10,340
But luckily, there is another way of doing this for all of us normal people, which is to

76
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,939
ask questions.

77
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,060
And in particular, to ask a certain type of question, a special question, what's known

78
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,540
as a deep question?

79
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,980
A deep question is something that invites us to talk about our values or our beliefs or

80
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,860
our experiences.

81
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,460
And that can sound a little intimidating, but it's actually much easier than it sounds.

82
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,220
For instance, instead of asking someone, where do you work, you could ask them, what do

83
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,740
you love about your job?

84
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,780
Instead of asking someone, where do you go to high school, you could say, what was high

85
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,780
school like?

86
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,100
Wait, what did you learn there?

87
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,580
What changed you there?

88
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:48,500
So differently, instead of asking about the facts of someone's life, we should ask

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
them how they feel about their life.

90
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,779
Because when we do, they tend to reveal to us who they really are.

91
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,500
They tend to tell us what they want not only out of this conversation, but how they hope

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,060
that we'll see them and how they want to see us, what matters to the most.

93
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,180
In fact, what SETI show us is that this is so powerful because these kinds of questions

94
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,379
allow us to be vulnerable and vulnerability and reciprocal vulnerability.

95
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:22,579
When we hear vulnerability and we become vulnerable in return, is the key to allowing us to connect

96
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,379
with other people.

97
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,379
And explain how this works.

98
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,379
I want to tell you a story about this guy.

99
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,100
Dr. Baffar a die.

100
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,460
Dr. a die is a cancer surgeon in New York City.

101
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,899
He specializes in prostate cancer, removing cancer tumors from prostate.

102
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,779
And he has this kind of interesting job because every single day a patient will come into

103
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,219
his office asking he thinks for medical advice.

104
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:53,299
And what he will tell them is you should not get surgery.

105
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:58,979
The prostate is located so close to the nerves of control, urination and sexual function

106
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,179
that it's a relatively risky surgery.

107
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:07,099
And what's more, most prostate tumors, they grow very, very slowly.

108
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,620
It's one of the slowest growing forms of cancer in existence.

109
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,939
There's a saying among doctors that if you have an old patient with prostate cancer, he's

110
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,700
going to die of old age before the cancer kills him.

111
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,100
And so Dr. a die would have these patients come in and he would tell them, look, I don't

112
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
think you should do anything.

113
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,340
In fact, I think you should do this thing called active surveillance.

114
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,100
What we're going to do is we're going to take a blood sample every six months.

115
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,420
We're going to do a biopsy every two years.

116
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,740
And if the tumor seems to change, we'll do an MRI.

117
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,540
And if we have to, we can do the surgery.

118
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,900
But otherwise, no radiation, no surgery, it's going to be okay.

119
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,780
And these patients would listen to him and then they would go home and they would discuss

120
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,460
it with their spouse.

121
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,780
And then they would walk in the next day and they would insist on having the surgery.

122
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,500
They would say, I absolutely want you to cut me open, take the tumor out as fast as

123
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
possible.

124
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,139
And for Dr. a die, this was bewildering.

125
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,900
He thought these would be the easiest conversations of his life.

126
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,420
He's telling people that they don't have to have surgery and he's a surgeon.

127
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,379
He told me that when this happens again and again and again, you start to realize this

128
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:10,340
isn't a problem with my patients.

129
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,819
This is the problem with me.

130
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,100
I'm doing something wrong.

131
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,259
And so he goes to these folks, these professors at the Harvard Business School and he asks

132
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,259
them for advice on what to do differently.

133
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,060
And they said, well, look, the biggest mistake that you're making is you are starting this

134
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,220
conversation all wrong.

135
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,180
You are starting by assuming that the patient walks into your room, into your exam room,

136
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,180
asking for advice and looking for medical solutions.

137
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,500
But you don't know if that's true.

138
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,139
You're not asking them any questions.

139
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,620
What you need to do is you need to start asking deep questions.

140
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,460
So two weeks later, after having this conversation, a 62 year old man comes into Dr. a die's office

141
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,780
for the first time.

142
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,500
He had just gotten his diagnosis of having prostate cancer.

143
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,899
And Dr. a die instead of giving him advice, instead of telling him what he ought to do,

144
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:56,980
he asks the question.

145
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,700
He asks the question, what does this cancer diagnosis mean to you?

146
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
And the man starts talking.

147
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,700
And he starts talking about how his father had died when he was 17 years old.

148
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,060
And this had just been so hard for him.

149
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,860
And it had been so hard for his mom.

150
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,060
And then he starts talking about how at work, he's worried that the younger employees,

151
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,860
if they find out that he has cancer, they're going to start looking at him differently.

152
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,020
They're going to be already writing them into the grave.

153
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,019
Even though he's got 20 or 30 years left on his career.

154
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,620
And then he starts talking about his grandchildren and his fears for the world they're inheriting

155
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,779
with climate change and everything else that's going on.

156
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,059
Dr. a die had expected this guy to at least bring up cancer, to at least mention mortality

157
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:47,019
or pain, but it never came up.

158
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:51,100
And at that moment, Dr. a die realized, because he had asked this deep question, that this

159
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,100
man wanted to have an emotional conversation.

160
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,340
He wanted to talk about how do we feel?

161
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,460
He needed to be hugged.

162
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,740
And so Dr. a die didn't actually hug him, right?

163
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,060
But he did the verbal equivalent.

164
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,700
And he started talking about how he understood that his own father had gotten sick and that

165
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
it had been terrifying for them.

166
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,779
But he had also brought them together in these ways that he didn't actually anticipate.

167
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,580
And they talk about this for eight minutes, just eight minutes.

168
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,899
And then Dr. a die says, look, do you mind?

169
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,899
There's some medical options I'd like to talk over with you.

170
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,699
Is that okay?

171
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,980
And they move into a practical conversation together.

172
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,539
And within seven more minutes, the man decides to do active surveillance and never looks

173
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,539
back.

174
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:40,220
Dr. a die's patients overwhelmingly now opt for active surveillance, his advice because

175
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,340
of this approach.

176
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,299
And the thing is, we can do this in any conversation.

177
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:46,819
It doesn't have to be an important conversation.

178
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,179
It doesn't have to be life or death.

179
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:55,099
We can always connect more and better in a really profound way with the person that we're

180
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:58,539
speaking to if we want to.

181
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,859
Which brings me back to that experiment.

182
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:05,620
So just to remind you what you're supposed to do, walk out of the room, find a stranger,

183
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,059
ask them, when was the last time you cried in front of someone?

184
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,459
And then as soon as they answer, you answer the question yourself when you tell them when

185
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,019
you last cried.

186
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,740
Let me just say, this experiment has been done thousands and thousands of times.

187
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,299
Notably by a guy named Nick Eppley at the University of Chicago, people hate this experiment.

188
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,580
Nobody who participates comes in and is like, I'm really looking for this is going to be

189
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,299
a great time.

190
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,340
Instead, what they say is, I do not want to do this.

191
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,779
This sounds terrible.

192
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,180
But they're in an experiment and they basically have to do it, right?

193
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,180
They're in the room.

194
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
They get paired with the partner.

195
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,139
They go and they ask the question, ask an answer.

196
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:47,299
And then Nick Eppley afterwards asks them, what was that like?

197
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:51,059
And what people say are things like, oh my gosh, I felt so connected to that person,

198
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,419
more connected than people in other conversations in a while.

199
00:10:55,419 --> 00:11:00,620
I felt more caring towards them and I felt like they were really caring about me.

200
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,219
I felt like they listened so attentively and it was really easy for me to listen to

201
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,659
what they were saying.

202
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,740
Ultimately, almost everyone says, this is one of the best conversations that they've had

203
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,539
in the last week, the last month, the last year.

204
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:18,259
And they say things like, I'm so glad I got paired with that person because they were

205
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,980
exactly right for me.

206
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,779
When in truth, the only thing that was right is that they were a stranger and they had

207
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,740
the right question, the right kind of question to ask.

208
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,819
So why is this so powerful?

209
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,899
Why is asking this question?

210
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,139
Why does it help us connect so well?

211
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,219
Because it's a deep question.

212
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:39,659
It allows us to say something real.

213
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,579
And when we ask deep questions, we figure out which of the three conversations were

214
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,340
in, what we're talking about, what everyone really wants out of this dialogue.

215
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,820
And that is how we connect with each other.

216
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,900
We are living through a time of polarization and division.

217
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,100
We have forgotten how to have conversations.

218
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,860
But there's a science to it.

219
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,860
There are these folks who are known as super communicators who they are not special,

220
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,100
they're not more charismatic or they're not more outgoing than anyone else.

221
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,460
They've just learned skills that allow us to connect with others.

222
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,740
And there are skills that all of us can learn.

223
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:31,019
And that feeling you get after a wonderful conversation, that glow that you experience,

224
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:38,060
our brains have evolved to give us that, to crave connection.

225
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,740
So I hope you go out.

226
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,419
I hope you find a stranger.

227
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,620
And I hope you tell them all about the last time you cried in front of another person.

228
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,340
And then tell me how it went.

229
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
Thanks.

230
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,100
Oh, I'm so scared now.

231
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
Okay.
