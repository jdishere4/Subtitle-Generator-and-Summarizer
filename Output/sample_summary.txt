 I'm going to ask you to participate in an experiment, which is that when you leave this room, when you go out into the world today, tomorrow, whenever you feel like it, I'd like you to ask and answer one question of someone who's a stranger. You might meet them on the bus, you might meet them walking down the street, and I'm going to show you the question that I'm going to ask you to ask and answer. The question is, when was the last time you cried in front of someone? Now just out of curiosity, how many of you are really excited about this experiment? Because there can be nothing that seems more intimidating or less fun than finding a stranger asking them when they've cried in front of someone else and then telling them about the time you cried in front of someone else.
